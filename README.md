Simple Shopping Cart
-------------------
Build a simple shopping cart that handles volume discounts as a class library with an accompanying test project.

Language: C#

Framework: .NET Core 3.1 or later

Expected time to complete: less than two hours.

Introduction
------------

Consider a store where items have prices per unit but also volume discount prices. For example, apples may be $1.00 each or 4 for $3.00.

Implement a shopping cart that accepts an arbitrary ordering of products (similar to what would happen at a checkout line) and then returns the correct total price for an entire shopping cart.
Pricing List

Here are the products listed by code and the prices to use (there is no sales tax):
Product Code 	Price
 _______________________________
| A |$2.00 each or 4 for $7.00  |
_________________________________
| B |$12.00                     |
_________________________________
| C |$1.25 or $6 for a six pack |
_________________________________
| D |$0.15                      |
|_______________________________|

Requirements
------------

There should be a top level point of sale object that implements the following ITerminal interface. You are free to design, implement, and add to the interface code however you wish. You are free to determine how you will specify the prices in the system:

public interface ITerminal
{
    void Scan(string item);
    decimal Total();
}

Rules
-----

Here are the minimal inputs you should use for your test cases. These test cases must be shown to work in your program:

Scan these items in this order: ABCDABAA; Verify the total price is $32.40.

Scan these items in this order: CCCCCCC; Verify the total price is $7.25.

Scan these items in this order: ABCD; Verify the total price is $15.40.
